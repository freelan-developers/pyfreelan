# pyfreelan

A HTTP(s) client/server integration library for
[freelan](http://www.freelan.org).

## Contribution

Contributions to `pyfreelan` are most welcome ! However, please note that the continuous integration process enforces the following things:

 - All unit-tests/doc-tests must pass.
 - No pep8 error are found, neither in the code or the tests.
 - Coverage is 100%.

 You obviously need to write tests whenever you add/modify a feature. Don't forget to update the relevant documentation entries as well.

 This may seem crazy but I firmly believe that those things help maintain a higher code quality and reduce the chances of bugs.

 Feel free to ask for help if you are stuck writing tests or are not sure what to test/how to document.
